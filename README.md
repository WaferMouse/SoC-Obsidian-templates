# Jocelyne's SoC Obsidian templates

Contained in this repo are three templates for Obsidian intended for School of Code cohort. Below are directions on how to make best use of them.

## Setting up templates

Then download the templates from this repo and drag them into your templates folder in Obsidian.

## Daily note template

Open the Command Palette (Ctrl-P on Windows, Cmd-P on Mac) and search for "today" to create a daily note for the day.
